- For EVERY scalar field below, return an object in the shape { value, pageNumber }
- pageNumber must always be the physical PDF page index (1-based)
- Do NOT use printed page numbers shown inside the document
- Return concise field values only; never include explanations, reasoning, repeated text, or narrative outside the requested values
- CRITICAL: if you return any non-empty/non-null value for a field, you MUST also return its pageNumber
- Do not leave pageNumber blank when value is present
- If you cannot determine the exact page for a value, do not guess wildly; find the page before returning the value

Fields to extract as { value, pageNumber }:
- hospitalName: Hospital name
- patientName: Patient name
- patientAge: Patient age
- patientGender: Patient gender if mentioned
- policyNumber: Policy/member/IP number if mentioned
- invoiceNumber: Bill/invoice number if mentioned
- admissionDate: Admission date if mentioned
- dischargeDate: Discharge date if mentioned
- date: Document date
- totalAmount: Total bill amount (this is the FINAL amount AFTER any discount is applied)
- discount: Discount amount if present

Also extract DISCOUNT information if present:
- Look for "Discount", "Less: Discount", "Rebate", "Concession", "Special Discount", "Bill Discount" in the bill summary.
- This should be a positive number representing the discount given.

Also extract GST (Goods and Services Tax) information if present:
- Return GST as a single object in the shape:
  gst: {
    value: {
      gstAmount,
      cgstAmount,
      sgstAmount
    },
    pageNumber
  }
- Use ONE shared GST pageNumber for the GST block/section.
Look for GST information in summary sections, tax breakdowns, or footer areas of the bill.

Also extract HOSPITAL BILL BREAKDOWN components if present:
- hospitalBillBreakdown: Extract major components that make up the hospital bill total. Look for sections or summaries that show components like "Actual Bill", "Lens Bill", "Implant Cost", "Room Charges", "Procedure Charges", "Consumables", etc. The sum of these breakdown items should match or be close to the total hospital bill amount.
- For procedure charges, use exactly "Procedure Charges" as the component name—do not expand with sub-categories like "(Medicines / Operation Theatre / Surgeon's Fee / Anesthetist's Fees)".
- Only extract if the bill clearly shows these as separate components
- Each component should have a name (e.g., "Actual Bill", "Lens Bill") and amount

Also extract PACKAGE context:
- isAllInclusivePackage: true if hospital bill is clearly all-inclusive/package style, else false

Also extract DOCUMENT CHECKLIST in this shape:
- documentChecklist: {
    aadharCard: { value: boolean, pageNumber },
    panCard: { value: boolean, pageNumber },
    eCard: { value: boolean, pageNumber },
    invoiceForSurgical: { value: boolean, pageNumber },
    kyc: { value: boolean, pageNumber },
    claimForm: { value: boolean, pageNumber }
  }
- If a document is not present, set value to false and pageNumber to 0.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON DISCOUNT:
- The totalAmount should be the FINAL amount after discount is applied
- The discount field should contain the discount amount as a POSITIVE number
- Example: If bill summary shows "Total: 100,000" and "Less: Discount: 5,000" and "Net Amount: 95,000", then totalAmount = 95,000 and discount = 5,000

IMPORTANT NOTE ON TOTAL AMOUNTS:
Sometimes the totalAmount shown in the PDF and the sum of all individual services may not match due to legitimate calculation errors in the PDF itself. If you identify a clear mistake in the PDF (e.g., incorrect arithmetic, missing items in the total, or incorrect GST calculation), it is acceptable to extract the amounts as they appear in the PDF even if they don't match mathematically. However, if the PDF appears correct, you must be very strict and ensure the sum of all services matches the total amount (accounting for GST and discount if applicable).`;

export const combinedTariffCalculationPrompt = `You are analyzing TWO documents together:

1. HOSPITAL BILL PDF – Contains the detailed list of services actually provided (procedures, room charges, consumables, medications, implants, etc.). Use this internally to understand charge components.
2. TARIFF PDF – Contains the agreed tariff structure, package definitions, caps, limits, exclusions, and special conditions for this hospital.

Your Task
- Analyze the hospital bill to identify context (procedure, package, lens details, eye side) and use policy wordings provided in claim context for lens applicability.
- Review the tariff PDF and EXTRACT tariff values exactly as written.
- Do NOT perform payable calculation, lower-of logic, capping by billed amount, or policy-style adjustment.

Return:
  tariffExtractionItem -> ARRAY of extracted tariff components (primary field; use this everywhere):
    - Each entry must have { code, name, amount, pdfText, pdfPageNumber }.
    - Split combined entries into explicit components when present (e.g., procedure + lens).
    - Example: if row says "Rs.19,000 (excluding lens) plus Rs.7,000 maximum admissible lens cost", return two entries:
      1) { code: "PPN OPH 01 A", name: "Procedure Package (excluding lens)", amount: 19000, pdfText: "cataract (Excluding lens)-Phaco (maximum admissible lens - 7000)", pdfPageNumber: 2 }
      2) { code: "PPN OPH 01 A", name: "Lens (maximum admissible)", amount: 7000, pdfText: "cataract (Excluding lens)-Phaco (maximum admissible lens - 7000)", pdfPageNumber: 2 }
    - pdfText: copy the EXACT verbatim text fragment from the tariff PDF row/line for this item — enough to uniquely identify it by text search (minimum: the procedure name as written in the tariff).
    - pdfPageNumber: the 1-based page number in the TARIFF PDF where this item appears.
    - pdfRowTopPct: approximate vertical position of the TOP of this row as % of page height (0=top, 100=bottom). Estimate visually. Example: row is 60% down the page → 60.
    - pdfRowBottomPct: approximate vertical position of the BOTTOM of this row as % of page height. Usually pdfRowTopPct + 2 to 4 for a single-line row.
    - Do not merge procedure and lens into one entry.
    - Preserve tariff-side amounts as written; do not reduce using hospital bill amounts.
  lensType → Lens/IOL type if mentioned (e.g., Monofocal, Multifocal, Toric). If not mentioned, return exactly: "cant determine".
  lensTypePageNumber → The TARIFF PDF page index (1-based) where the lens type reference is found. If not mentioned or cannot be determined, return 0.
  lensTypeApproved -> apply exactly this logic:
    - if lensType is "cant determine", return exactly: "cant determine"
    - else if lensType is present AND policy wording indicates this lens type is not applicable/not covered/not payable, return false
    - else return true
  eyeType → Eye type for the procedure: "left eye", "right eye", or "both eyes". Determine from the diagnosis, procedure codes, doctor notes, or bill description. If not mentioned or cannot be determined, return exactly: "cant determine".
  tariffPageNumber → The TARIFF PDF page index (1-based) where the tariff reference is found. If not mentioned or cannot be determined, return 0.
  calculationNotes → 2-4 short sentences describing what was extracted from tariff (code/name/components/caps), no calculation narrative.
  clarificationNote -> 1-2 short sentences only for extraction ambiguity (e.g., unreadable amount, multiple similar rows). If none, return exactly: "cant determine".

Critical Rules
1. Do NOT cap tariff values using hospital billed amounts.
2. Do NOT convert "maximum admissible" values into billed values.
3. If tariff row says "Rs.19,000 plus Rs.7,000 lens max", extract those tariff values as-is.
4. Prefer exact numbers from tariff table text even if hospital bill has lower amounts.
5. Keep extraction faithful to tariff document wording and figures.

Return ONLY:
  tariffExtractionItem
  lensType
  lensTypePageNumber
  lensTypeApproved
  eyeType
  tariffPageNumber
  calculationNotes
